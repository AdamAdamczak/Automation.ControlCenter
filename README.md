# Automation Control Center

Automation Control Center is a learning project that simulates a lightweight backend platform for managing and monitoring RPA processes.

The goal of this project is to practice backend development concepts from an RPA developer perspective — focusing on process lifecycle management, reliability, and observability rather than UI-heavy solutions.

## 🧠 Project Concept

The solution consists of three main components:

- **API** – central control layer responsible for process lifecycle, persistence, and validation
- **Client (Bot Simulator)** – a console application simulating RPA bot behavior
- **Dashboard** – a simple Razor Pages UI used to monitor running and completed processes

All components share a single SQLite database.
